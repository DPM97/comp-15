Purpose: What does the program do?

  Create a functional char arraylist class which includes all of the constructors, destructors, operators, 
  and methods described in the briefing.

Compile Instructions: How to run the program.
  1. make build
  2. ./main

Usage: Why is this useful?

  Assuming we are just comparing an arraylist to a standard array, the dynamic arraylist allows for resizing & a more efficient use of space.
  In this case, we don't know how many elements we are going to need. This would be an issue for the array, however, we can re-size the arraylist
  data structure as needed. Obviously, the arraylist implementation will not be as efficent (time complexity wise) as a normal array with all of the 
  resizing methods, but this small sacrifice is usually worth it.

Testing: How the implementation was tested.

  All of my testing was completed in the testCharArrayList.cpp main function. Basically, it runs through each function & in between prints
  the visual representation of the arraylist. This shows that the methods are working correctly, and the data structure is being manipulated 
  accordingly in these cases.
