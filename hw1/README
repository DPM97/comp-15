Class: Comp 15
Assignment: HW1

Purpose: What does the program do?

  The purpose of this homework was to write a class and supporting methods
  which manipulate the origional array on which the class is built.
  Using these methods, it will essentially create an "array list" for chars.

Acknowledgements: Help that I recieved.

Files：Files used.
  CharArrayList.cpp - the class which includes all arraylist functionality 
  and manipulation.
  CharArrayList.h - the header file for CharArrayList.cpp 
  testCharArrayList.cpp - tests the arraylist implementation
  Makefile - builds the program

Compile Instructions: How to run the program.
  All build commands are consolodated in the makefile.
  1. make build
  2. ./main

  Compiling without makefile:
    1. clang++ -g3 -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -c -o CharArrayList.o CharArrayList.cpp
    2. clang++ -g3 -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -c -o testCharArrayList.o testCharArrayList.cpp
    3. clang++ -g3 -o main CharArrayList.o testCharArrayList.o
    4. ./main

Usage: Why is this useful?

  Assuming we are just comparing an arraylist to a standard array, 
  the dynamic arraylist allows for resizing & a more efficient use of space.
  In this case, we don't know how many elements we are going to need. 
  This would be an issue for the array, however, we can re-size the arraylist
  data structure as needed. Obviously, the arraylist implementation will not be 
  as efficent (time complexity wise) as a normal array with all of the 
  resizing methods, but this small sacrifice is usually worth it.

Testing: How the implementation was tested.

  All of my testing was completed in the testCharArrayList.cpp file. 
  In short, there is one method to check the functionality of each 
  function / constructor / operator in the CharArrayList class.
  All cases that are supposed to throw errors are caught and printed
  to the console without terminating the program.
