       Project 1 - phase 1
       Dylan Maloy

    B. Purpose:
         - Implement a DatumStack and the parseRString method

    C. Acknowledgements:
         - How to create an istream from a string (for testing)
         - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/499381/optimal-way-to-get-
         a-string-or-char-into-an-istream
    
    D. Files:
         - DatumStack.h: header file for the DatumStack class
         - DatumStack.cpp: class that implements a stack for Datum elements

         - parser.h: header file for parser.cpp
         - parser.cpp: cpp file which includes the parseRString method

         - testDatumStack.cpp: file to run tests on the stack & parseRString

    E. How to Run:
         - make Part1 (make sure Datum.o is in the project folder)
         - ./Part1 or valgrind ./Part1
    
    F. Data Structures used:
         - A stack was used to house the Datum objects. 
         
    G. Testing: 
         - Testing was done in the testDatumStack.cpp file. It tests all 
         parts of the DatumStack class as well as the parseRString method
         that will be in the RPNCalc class in the second phase of the project.
