    B. Purpose:
         - The purpose of this program was to implement an RPN Calculator based
         on a stack data structure. This includes the creation of many functions
         which would allow for the execution of commands either from the cin, 
         or from a file.

    D. Files:
         - DatumStack.h: header file for the DatumStack class
         - DatumStack.cpp: class that implements a stack for Datum elements.
           The DatumStack is made on top of a vector, and utilizes the vector
           functions to create a stack.

         - RPNCalc.h: header file for the RPNCalc class
         - RPNCalc.cpp: class that implements the RPNCalc / has all of the
           functions that parse the input. The main methods that make the 
           decisions are chooseCommand and parseInput. These methods parse the
           incoming stream & excecute the correct methods which make changes to
           the stack (thereby solving the problem).

         - testing.h: header file for the testing class
         - testing.cpp: class that implements all of the tests for the program.
           It contains many methods, which when combined test every aspect of
           the RPNCalculator with various inputs and edge cases included. 

         - mainTesting.cpp: file that creates an instance of testing and runs it
         - main.cpp: file that creates an RPNCalc instance and runs it

         Below are some of the files I used to test more complex commands.
         - testOperate.cylc
         - testCompare.cylc

    E. How to Run:
          Testing:
               - make Testing
               - ./Testing 

          CalcYouLater:
               - make CalcYouLater
               - ./CalcYouLater
    
    F. Data Structures used:
         - A stack was used to house the Datum objects. This was described
         above in more detail inside of the DatumStack file description.
         
    G. Testing: 
         - I decided that it was best to keep my testing inside of a main class.
         This class is called testing.cpp. When ran, there are various functions
         that run calculations / various inputs on RPNCalc instances and record
         the output. These cases include various edge cases / instances where
         the program should throw an error / exception. For the more complex
         testing functions in the class, I would parse a "file" and then
         executed it. These files were testOperate.cylc and testCompare.cylc. 
         This ended up being much easier to implement than making these changes
         to the stack manually. 

         Protocol:
          - To run the testing protocol reference the "How to Run" section
          above. When running the executable, there will be an output string
          where you can view all of the tests and thier outcomes.
