Assignment: HW2

Purpose: What does the program do?

  The purpose of this homework was to write c class and the supporting methods
  to manipulate "node" structs to create a "linked list". Using these methods, 
  it will be able to chain together said nodes and be able to create a list similar
  in function to that of an array.

Acknowledgements: Help that I recieved.

Files：Files used.
  LinkedList.cpp - template / class which has all of the linked list functionality.
  LinkedList.h - header file for the LinkedList class
  testLinkedList.cpp - testing file for the linked list (tests every method)


Compile Instructions: How to run the program.
  All build commands are consolodated in the makefile.
  1. make
  2. ./cheshire 
    or 
    valgrind -v ./cheshire

  Compiling without makefile:
    1. clang++ -g3 -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -c -o CharArrayList.o CharArrayList.cpp
    2. clang++ -g3 -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -c -o testCharArrayList.o testCharArrayList.cpp
    3. clang++ -g3 -o main CharArrayList.o testCharArrayList.o
    4. ./main

Usage: Why is this useful?

  Assuming comparison to a normal array or a dynamic arraylist, there are a few
  reasons why the linked list might be useful. Firstly, the linkedlist is always
  the correct size. Furthermore, the ability to change the pointers of nodes allows
  the addition of new nodes and deletion of existing nodes to be much less intensive. 
  To do this, you can just change the next and prev pointers on the nodes on either
  side of the index you are trying to insert (or delete) at. A possible downside, however,
  is the amount of space that a node (also the entire list) takes up.

Testing: How the implementation was tested.

  All of my testing was completed in the testLinkedList.cpp file. 
  In short, there is one method to check the functionality of each 
  function / constructor / operator in the LinkedList class.
  All cases which could throw errors included a error case which would 
  be caught by the program and printed to the console. All of the test
  cases in testLinkedList.cpp are implemented using chars, however, I have 
  tested them using integers successfully.

  Below is the basic testing protocol for all methods within the LinkedList class:
    1. print the linked list before manipulation
    2. print the type of manipulation that is going to occur
    3. call the method that is being tested
    4. print the manipulated linked list (or variable that changed if not the list)
    5. if applicable, test an error-throwing case & catch/print the error
